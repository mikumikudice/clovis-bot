# who is clovis
clovis is the official bot of the lugoo server! he can roll dices, kick users and etc.
# how does clovis work?
he's written in lua and uses [discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) to be run. you should check it out.
# why clovis?
I'm creating this repo to manage versions of clovis and updates, and also to make a helpful tutorial/guide of how **I** would make a bot
# trivia
clovis is currently only availabe for my own server -- and the server is also only available for my friends --, therefore, the messages and commands are in portuguese and I won't be accepting pull requests (for now). enjoy!
